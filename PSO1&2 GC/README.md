### Bank Mod
The bank mod is a complex code that takes the value of your balance in the bank and transmutes the first item in the bank to match that value

*i.e.) bank balance = 13312 == 0x3400 : first item in bank will be a Red Sword*

Item Name   | Decimal Value | Hex Value
------------|---------------| ----------
Red Sword | 13312 | 0x3400
